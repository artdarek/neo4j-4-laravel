	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	*/

## Usage

Nodes are the first of the two major entity types in a graph database. 
A node is a collection of zero or more key-value pairs. 
Neo4jPHP makes it very easy to create and work with nodes.

### Creating new node

The following code snippet creates some nodes, sets some properties on each, and saves the nodes to the server. 

```php

$arthur = Neo4j::makeNode();
$arthur->setProperty('name', 'Arthur Dent')
    ->setProperty('mood', 'nervous')
    ->setProperty('home', 'small cottage')
    ->save();

$ford = Neo4j::makeNode();
$ford->setProperty('name', 'Ford Prefect')
    ->setProperty('occupation', 'travel writer')
    ->save();

$arthurId = $arthur->getId();

```

### Retrieve a Node by ID and Update

Now that the node has been created, the node's id can be used to retrieve the node from the server later.
The following code retrieves the node and prints its properties:

```php

$character = Neo4j::getNode($arthurId);

foreach ($character->getProperties() as $key => $value) {
    echo "$key: $value\n";
}

// prints:
// name: Arthur Dent
// mood: nervous
// home: small cottage

$character->removeProperty('mood')
    ->setProperty('home', 'demolished')
    ->save();

foreach ($character->getProperties() as $key => $value) {
    echo "$key: $value\n";
}

// prints:
// name: Arthur Dent
// home: demolished

```

### Delete a Node

A node can be deleted as long as its ID has been set. 
Also note that a node cannot be deleted if it is the start or end point of any relationship.

```php

$earth = Neo4j::getNode(123);
$earth->delete();

```
